# Architecture

PicForge processes files locally in the browser. React 19/Vite 8 provide the UI;
Zustand owns compression state, and i18next provides five locales. There is no
media-processing server, account system or upload pipeline.

## Code map

| Location | Responsibility |

| `packages/app/src/CompressionWorkspace.tsx` | Compression workspace and active-tool import |
| `packages/app/src/stores/` and `hooks/` | Settings/file state, scheduling, epochs and result publication |
| `packages/worker/src/` | Image routing (Compat/animation), Compat Worker pool, decode/resize |
| `packages/codecs/src/` | Pinned jSquash encoders, settings and format contracts |
| `packages/app/src/animation/` | GIF/APNG to animated WebP with FFmpeg |
| `packages/app/src/motion/` | Android extraction, Apple pairing, HEIC and video conversion |
| `packages/app/src/utils/resourceBudget.ts` | Shared memory estimates and admission queue |

Packages are ESM; workspace dependencies export TypeScript source. Root tooling
and TypeScript configuration are shared. Exact dependency versions belong to
package manifests and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Compression and animation

`fileStore/settingsStore → useAutoCompress → autoCompressController → imageProcessor`

The controller owns settings snapshots, dimension checks, selected-file priority,
memory admission, cancellation and task epochs. It publishes results only while
the task remains current. Global edits do not overwrite per-image snapshots.
Advanced options are normalized to the active format; presets replace format,
quality and advanced options while keeping resize settings.

`hooks/processingPool.ts` registers Compat for static images and a separate animation
engine. Static output formats are JPEG, WebP, AVIF and PNG:

- Compat sends the original Blob to its encoding Worker. `workerDecode.ts` uses
  `createImageBitmap` and `OffscreenCanvas` to decode/resize before jSquash encoding.
- The main-thread Canvas path handles SVG and missing Worker capabilities or a file
  the Worker cannot decode. Cancellation, timeout, safety limits and settings or
  encoding failures do not trigger this decode fallback.
- Both Canvas paths share `calculateResizeGeometry` and `drawScaled`: low-quality
  exact halvings followed by a high-quality final draw of at most 2:1 downscale.
  `contain` never upscales, `cover` crops centrally and `stretch` uses exact dimensions.
- Eligible PNG-to-PNG requests without resizing strip ancillary chunks and send
  the original image data directly to OxiPNG. A non-cancellation/non-timeout encoder
  failure retries through the original Blob's Canvas path. Transparency and other
  unsupported PNG cases use normal decode/encode.
- GIF/APNG route to the animation engine before static-engine selection. They
  export animated WebP; unsupported settings return errors rather than a silent
  first-frame result. See [animation semantics and limits](animation-pipeline.md).

Original Blob/File objects remain available for retry. Transfer an RGBA buffer
directly only when its view owns the entire buffer; otherwise copy the visible
range. No retry reads a detached ArrayBuffer.

## Scheduling and lifetime

One page-wide resource budget covers static compression, animation and Live Photo
work. Estimates include source pixels, intermediate downscale canvases, target
pixels and engine working memory. They are admission heuristics, not measured RSS
or a hard process-memory ceiling; an oversized admitted task runs alone. Source
and pixel rejection limits remain separate.

Compression concurrency is bounded by its Worker pool. Workers are created on
demand, retired after large tasks and released when idle. WASM heaps cannot shrink
while a Worker remains alive; termination does not prove immediate OS memory or
CPU recovery. Acquire memory budget before entering the shared FFmpeg lane so a
lane holder never waits for budget.

Only runtime-class compression errors receive automatic retries. Settings/timeout
errors can requeue after settings change. Cancellation and stale epochs cannot
publish a result or count as infrastructure failures.

## Motion and Live Photos

Android extraction finds the embedded JPEG/MP4 boundaries and preserves original
bytes without re-encoding or loading Apple engines. The parser bounds container
scanning; supported layouts must satisfy its structural checks.

iOS pairs Apple content identifiers where both files supply them, with a basename
fallback that remains unverified. Jobs run serially; within a job, still and video
conversion run concurrently subject to the shared budget. A failure cancels the
other half and produces one terminal outcome.

- HEIC decodes in a Worker, then a separate MozJPEG encoder writes baseline JPEG
  (about twice as fast as progressive on camera stills for ~3% more bytes at the
  same measured quality). The Worker first tries the browser's decoder (Safari:
  ImageIO) drawn into an sRGB canvas, but only for matrix/TRC ICC, untagged or
  convertible SDR nclx sources, and accepts it only at the clap/irot display size
  from `heif.ts`; otherwise, or on any failure, the pinned libheif/libde265 decodes.
  Matrix/TRC ICC and supported nclx descriptions convert to sRGB. LUT-only RGB ICC
  is embedded in the JPEG instead of claiming an unavailable conversion. JPEG
  input is retained. Exports are web derivatives, not HDR/metadata archives.
- `movDemux.ts`, `videoFrames.ts` and `mp4Mux.ts` implement the WebCodecs path:
  sample timing, crop/rotation in YUV, range handling and MP4 H.264/AAC output.
  Eligibility requires source timestamps, supported 8-bit SDR video, valid distinct
  nonnegative timestamps and supported codec configurations. Hardware acceleration
  is selected by the runtime; the requested preference is `no-preference`.
- AAC audio can be copied; other supported source audio uses a concurrent FFmpeg
  helper. Unsupported video/settings, including explicit 30 fps, or WebCodecs
  failure use FFmpeg from the original File via WORKERFS. The clean-aperture adapter
  remains required for the pinned FFmpeg core.
- WebCodecs uses one dedicated Worker per conversion. Two runtime failures disable
  it for the page session; unsupported input does not. The Worker treats 5 s
  without decoder/encoder output while waiting on it (including `flush()`) as a
  stall; a stalled `quality`-mode encoder retries once in `realtime` mode, which
  the session then keeps. This works around macOS 27 Safari, whose software H.264
  encoder holds up to 16 frames while WebKit passes it only 4
  ([WebKit PR 74602](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/74602), bug 324827);
  keep it until shipping Safari includes the fix and a device check passes without
  it. The page watchdog fires after 30 s without Worker messages, excluding the
  FFmpeg audio helper, which is aborted when the attempt ends. Cancellation rejects without
  fallback. The video paths must preserve frame count, PTS, geometry and colour
  semantics; their encoded pixels and output sizes need not be identical.

The [validation guide](validation.md) describes camera, playback and real-device
checks. A successful conversion alone does not establish native preview support.

## Assets, offline behavior and deployment

Dev/build preparation verifies the [four versioned HEIC files](heif-build.md),
copies other pinned codecs and checks byte equality between codec packages and
static WASM. Vite maps upstream fallback URLs to same-origin `/wasm/`, including
Worker imports. Preserve the single-thread AVIF/OxiPNG patches and codec notices.

The service worker precaches the app shell and generated `precache.json` entries.
Heavy engines load lazily and work offline only after successful caching; each
engine version has its own cache. A new worker waits for the update prompt, and
one previous shell generation retains hashed modules for open tabs.

Dev/preview bind to loopback and, like production, are not cross-origin isolated:
no path needs SharedArrayBuffer. Production HTTP headers belong to the host
configuration, which is outside this repository. Built HTML constrains
connections and resource destinations with CSP; `script-src` is deliberately
unrestricted for WASM compatibility, so this is not a universal egress guarantee.

[Woodpecker](../.woodpecker/test-then-publish.yml) tests/builds/verifies once on
`master` pushes, then publishes that exact `dist/`. Only publication mounts the
deployment directory. The publisher uses checksum verification, a lock, stale-run
rejection, an atomic switch and current/previous release retention. See
[validation](validation.md#ci-and-publication) for the gates.

Keep root/app versions and `CACHE_VERSION` aligned when shipping. Preserve all
third-party notices and required codec source/build materials; the app's MIT
license does not relicense FFmpeg, libheif or other bundled components.
