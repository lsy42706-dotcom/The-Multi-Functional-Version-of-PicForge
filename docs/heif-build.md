# HEIC static assets and rebuilding

PicForge includes a prebuilt **libheif 1.23.4 + libde265 1.1.1** decoder as
versioned project files. Ordinary development, CI and deployment use those exact
bytes; they do not download a separate codec artifact or run Emscripten.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
# or: pnpm build
```

## Versioned files

The owner explicitly approved these four files under
`packages/app/public/wasm/heif-1.23.4-de265-1.1.1/` for version control:

- `libheif.mjs` — the browser module (64,151 bytes).
- `libheif.wasm` — the compiled decoder (1,198,749 bytes).
- `LICENSE` — both upstream license texts.
- `build-manifest.json` — source URLs/SHA-256 hashes, native/toolchain versions,
  flags and output hashes.

Vite copies this directory into the static site. The HEIC worker lazily loads
`/wasm/heif-1.23.4-de265-1.1.1/libheif.mjs`; the module loads the adjacent WASM.
Both remain same-origin and work offline after successful loading/caching.
No personal image or test export belongs in this directory.

Only this release's four files are exempted from the generated-HEIF ignore rule.
Other generated builds, temporary output and `dist/` remain ignored. Include all
four files together when committing; the application must not ship a module and
WASM from different builds.
`.gitattributes` disables Git newline conversion for this directory so that the
module, license and manifest keep their exact hashed bytes on Windows and Linux.

## Integrity and ordinary CI

Dev/build preparation checks native versions, critical flags and every artifact
hash from the manifest. Missing, stale or mismatched files stop the build; restore
the versioned files instead of installing a compiler for an ordinary checkout.
Site-output verification also rejects obsolete HEIF directories.

The worker checks actual libheif 1.23.4 and libde265 1.1.1 versions before passing
untrusted bytes to the decoder. The versioned URL and service-worker cache
revision isolate decoder versions from one another.

Woodpecker uses the checked-out static assets in one
[test-then-publish workflow](../.woodpecker/test-then-publish.yml). It runs the asset
gate, builds and verifies the site, then publishes that exact output. There is no
Emscripten image or native compilation in normal CI.
The manifest checks detect missing/mixed/corrupted files; they are not a signature
authenticating a compromised repository or build host.

```sh
pnpm test:heif
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
node scripts/verify-site-output.mjs packages/app/dist
```

The existing `pnpm test:browser` checks stale native-version rejection and old
cache eviction. The approved fixture paths in [sample/README.md](../sample/README.md)
enable camera conversion, geometry/PTS, downloads and cached offline conversion.
Keep all generated media temporary.

## Rebuild only when upgrading the decoder

The source build is retained for reproducibility and deliberate upgrades. It is
not a prerequisite for using the project. Activate **Emscripten 3.1.61** using the
[official SDK instructions](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).
Install an up-to-date Python 3.10+ with `tarfile.data_filter`, CMake 3.16+, and
Ninja or Make (Windows requires Ninja). Node must be on PATH.

```sh
python3 scripts/build-heif.py
```

On Windows, `pnpm codecs:heif` uses `python`. An explicit SDK path is also supported:

```powershell
python scripts/build-heif.py --emsdk C:/tools/emsdk
```

The script checks the toolchain version, downloads checksum-pinned upstream
archives, builds static libraries, links upstream `post.js`, and checks both
actual native versions before replacing the four output files. Intermediate
sources/objects stay in an OS temporary directory; `--work-dir PATH` allows reuse.
No media is uploaded. Builds on other toolchains/platforms are not promised to
be byte-identical; normal CI consumes the checked-in build instead.

The checked-in manifest records the exact build toolchain and output hashes.
Only libde265 HEVC decoding is enabled; other codecs, plugins,
WebCodecs, uncompressed HEIF, dynamic JavaScript execution, filesystem support
and pthreads are disabled. The decoder enables libheif's backend security-limits
integration.

For a future version change, update source pins, static directory, ignore
exceptions, build/runtime checks, browser regressions and cache revision together.
Review the generated manifest and normal camera/offline regression results before
replacing the versioned files. Preserve upstream notices and the matching build
recipe. Do not restore the old libheif-js 1.23.2 dependency.

## Redistribution

Keep the LGPL notices and build manifest with the binary. Before public binary
distribution, provide matching source archives and required relinking/build
materials under the upstream licenses; upstream URLs alone are not a substitute.
