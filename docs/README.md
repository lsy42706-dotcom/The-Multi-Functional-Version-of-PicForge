# PicForge documentation

PicForge is a browser-only image toolbox for image compression, Android Motion
Photo extraction and iOS Live Photo conversion. The working package version is
**0.19.2**; package metadata does not establish a release or deployment.

These documents describe the current implementation and its operating constraints.
Validation commands specify how to check a checkout, not a claim that it has passed.
